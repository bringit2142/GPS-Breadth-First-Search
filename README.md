# GPS-Breadth-First-Search
For this assignment we will writing a program that will use an adjacency list to build City and Map objects  with  the  end  of  finding  the  shortest  route  to  a  destination  from  a  starting  place  of  our choosing. For this assignment the data is provided to you along with the code contained within the if __name__ == "__main__". We will also assume that your script is named gps.py. Additionally  we  will  be  using  an  algorithm  named  Breadth  First  Search.  BFS  is  a  well  known algorithm used to search tree data structures. We start with a root node, then we look at all nodes in  the  next  level  down  before  moving  to  the  subsequent  level.  I  provide  pseudocode  for  this algorithm. If you would like to know more, please take a look at this MIT: Lecture 13: Breadth-First Search  (BFS).  BFS  is  a  very  well  known  algorithm  popularly  used  in  coding  interviews.  If  you  are interested  in  potentially  being  a  Software  Engineer  in  the  future,  I  highly  recommend  familiarity with BFS.
